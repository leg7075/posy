# posy's cursor mery ver
an edit of posy's cursor with an animated trans flag hourglass

new! black version available!

preview:

![images of the edited cursors](https://github.com/leg7075/posy/blob/main/preview.png?raw=true)

the edited cursors replace the `wait` and `progress` cursor states. everything else is the same as posy's default cursors.

made in figma and [realworld cursor editor](https://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-maker) by editing posy's [svg](https://michieldb.nl/other/cursors/posys-cursors-vectors-v4-svg.svg) files and trying my best to line them up to the original .cur files pixel-by-pixel.

if you would like me to make another variant of the cursor with different colours, send me a message on discord at `_m.ery` ^-^

## installation

download this repository as a .zip and install as directed by posy in `_info and instructions.txt`
